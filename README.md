# Task_link

I created a Task To-Do list for my Sinatra Project App.

I based the idea around being a homemaker. I wasted and lost a lot of post-it notes around the house. I wanted to change that with a to-do list specific for my family and the members in it. Every one can see what lists are created but can also create, edit and delete their own lists and tasks.
